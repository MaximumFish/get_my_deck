# get_my_deck
A simple scraper which checks the Steam Deck Refurb page for stock (64gb) since there doesn't seem to be any for refurbs out there and definitely no official way of doing this.
Other options for webscrapers were paid.

The parts that need editing are in the ## comments.

Requirements: 
Python - Latest is fine
Selenium Chrome Drivers for Python via PIP

Telegram bot token

Pycharm(or another IDE) - optional
If you require a different model size, then a tiny bit of googling/coding to change the text params to capture the different size model

To Run:

Command line - python get_my_deck.py

This is my first bit of public code - however I put a continuous checker for 20 secs and measures to reloop and rerun if things go wrong.
I've been able to keep it running straight off my Linux based laptop for over a week so far.
